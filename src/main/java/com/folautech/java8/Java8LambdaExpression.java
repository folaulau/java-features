/**
 * 
 * Lambda Expressions are a significant feature introduced to enable functional programming in the language. Lambda
 * expressions allow you to treat functions as first-class citizens, making it easier to express behavior as data, and
 * to pass functions as arguments to methods, return them from methods, or assign them to variables.
 * 
 * A Lambda Expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous functionâ€”a function without a name, often referred to
 * as a "lambda." It consists of parameters, an arrow ->, and a body.
 * 
 * Syntax of a Lambda Expression:
 * 
 * (parameters) -> { body }

     * Lambda expressions can be used wherever a functional interface is expected. A functional interface is an
     * interface that contains only one abstract method, often referred to as a "single abstract method" (SAM)
     * interface. These interfaces are also known as functional interfaces because they can be used with lambda
     * expressions.
     * 
     * Lambda expressions greatly improve code readability and provide a more concise way to define simple functions or
     * actions. They are widely used in combination with functional interfaces, making it easier to work with
     * collections, streams, and other functional programming constructs introduced in Java 8 and beyond.
