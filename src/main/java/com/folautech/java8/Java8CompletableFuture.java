/**
 * 
 * CompletableFuture was introduced in Java 8 and is part of the java.util.concurrent package. It represents a future
 * result of an asynchronous computationâ€”a way to write non-blocking asynchronous code in Java.
 * 
 * The main advantage of using CompletableFuture is its ability to chain multiple asynchronous operations, handle
 * exceptions, combine results, and apply transformations without blocking the execution thread.

    /***
     * The CompletableFuture.supplyAsync() method is a handy tool in Java's arsenal for asynchronous programming. It
     * provides a way to execute asynchronous computations that produce a result.
     * 
     * This method is used to initiate an asynchronous computation and return a CompletableFuture that will be completed
     * with the result of that computation. The computation itself is specified as a Supplier<T>, where T is the type of
     * the resulting value.
     * 
     * Key Takeaways:
     * 
     * CompletableFuture.supplyAsync() initiates a non-blocking, asynchronous computation.
     * 
     * By default, tasks execute in the ForkJoinPool.commonPool(), but you can provide your custom Executor.
     * 
     * It provides a more modern, fluent, and readable approach to asynchronous programming in Java, especially when
     * combined with other methods of CompletableFuture for chaining, combining, and handling results.
